      <p>
          A financial consultant examines the rates of return of stocks in a portfolio.  He takes a random samples of stocks and analyzes them.  Out of  <m>43</m>  analyzed stocks, the average % rate of return  <m>\bar{x}=15.806</m>  % return, with sample standard deviation <m>s=41.443</m>  % return.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the average % rate of return for the portfolio  is greater than <m>  5</m>  % return.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?

          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>99</m>% confidence interval for the  the average % rate of return for the portfolio.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>5</m> and standard error <m>SE=6.31999825029413</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The sample mean is <m>\bar{x}=15.806</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=1.7098105999470943</m>.

          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>99</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.6980661862199846</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the average % rate of return for the portfolio  has a <m>99</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[-1.24577357608807, 32.8577735760881]</m>.
