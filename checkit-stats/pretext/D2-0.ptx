          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age   is at most  <m>29.48 </m>  years.

              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age  is between <m>24.08 </m> and <m>30.44</m>  years.
