      <p>
          A nurse is measuring the systolic blood pressure of randomly selected adult males in a town.  Out of  <m>30</m>  selected adult males from the town  <m>\bar{x}=129.563</m>  mmhg, with sample standard deviation <m>s=22.571</m>  mmhg.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the average systolic blood pressure of adult males from this town  is greater than <m>  120</m>  mmhg.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu=120</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu\gneq120</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>120</m> and standard error <m>SE=4.12088194848304</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The sample mean is <m>\bar{x}=129.563</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=2.3206197410047835</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.013771606680504922</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>95</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.0452296421327016</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the average systolic blood pressure of adult males from this town  has a <m>95</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[121.134850087233, 137.991149912767]</m>.
