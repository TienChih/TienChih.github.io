      <p>
          A political scientist compares the amount of money donated to campaigns for poltitical parties A and B.  Out of  <m>48</m>  observed members of Party A, the average sample donation was  <m>\bar{x}_1=2774.349</m>  dollars, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=361.875</m>  dollars.  Then out of <m>48</m>  observed members of Party B, the average sample donation was  <m>\bar{x}_2=2627.9500000000003</m>  dollars, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=650.312</m>  dollars.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the difference in average donation between members of Party A and Party B, <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>, is greater than <m>  0</m>  dollars.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the  the difference in average donation between members of Party A and Party B.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2=0</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu_1-\mu_2\gneq0</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0</m> and standard error <m>SE=107.418497492382</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The observesd difference of sample means is <m>\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}=146.399</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=1.362884451166176</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.08970667724563264</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>95</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.011740513729766</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the difference in average donation between members of Party A and Party B  has a <m>95</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[-69.6991433294037, 362.497143329404]</m>.
