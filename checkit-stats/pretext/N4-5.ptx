      <p>
          A manufacturer wants to compare the number of defects to types of machines produce.  For a month, machines of both type were observed.  Out of  <m>25</m>  Model A machines, the average number of defects was  <m>\bar{x}_1=1.156</m>  defects, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=0.545</m>  defects.  Then out of <m>25</m>  Model B machines, the average number of defects was  <m>\bar{x}_2=1.383</m>  defects, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=0.614</m>  defects.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the difference in average number of defects between Model A and Model B, <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>, is less than <m>  0</m>  defects.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the  the difference in average number of defects between Model A and Model B.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

  <answer>
      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2=0</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu_1-\mu_2\lneq0</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.164197563928336</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The observesd difference of sample means is <m>\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}=-0.227</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=-1.382480924620015</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.08977741643252407</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>95</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.063898561628025</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the difference in average number of defects between Model A and Model B  has a <m>95</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[-0.565887116014518, 0.111887116014518]</m>.
