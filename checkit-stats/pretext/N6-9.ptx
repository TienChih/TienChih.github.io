          The average daily calcium intake for test subjects under Regiment A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=970.906</m>  mg, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=75.974</m> mg, and sample size <m>n_1=49</m> test subjects.

          The average daily calcium intake for test subjects under Regiment C was  <m>\bar{x}_3=973.389</m>  mg, with sample standard deviation <m>s_3=58.249</m> mg, and sample size <m>n_3=49</m> test subjects.
