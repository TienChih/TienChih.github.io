          A study is conducted comparing the age of children to their Forced Exhalation Volume (FEV) (in liters), in order to see the impact on age on lung function.  Children of different ages have their FEV tested by physicians.

      <p>
          Consider this table of data collected comparing Age measured in years, and FEV measured in liters:
