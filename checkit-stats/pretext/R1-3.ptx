      <p>
          A study is conducted comparing the weight of a species of bird (in grams) to it's (in mm).  Birds of this species are captured, their dimensions recorded and released.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Consider this table of data collected comparing Weight measured in grams, and Wingspan measured in mm:
