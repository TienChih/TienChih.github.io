      <p>
          A sociologist compares number of daily police stops in two different neighborhoods of the same city with similar size.  Out of  <m>21</m>  observed days, the daily number of stops for Neighborhood A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=61.702</m>  stops, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=14.551</m>  stops.  Then out of <m>21</m>  observed days, the daily number of stops for Neighborhood A was  <m>\bar{x}_2=69.344</m>  stops, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=7.261</m>  stops.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the difference in average daily police stops between  Neighborhood A and Neighborhood B, <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>, is not equal to <m>  0</m>  stops.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the  the difference in average daily police stops between  Neighborhood A and Neighborhood B.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2=0</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu_1-\mu_2\neq0</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0</m> and standard error <m>SE=3.54866656378877</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The observesd difference of sample means is <m>\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}=-7.642</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=-2.1534849393798625</m>.
          </li>

              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.043661091099902904</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>95</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.085963447265865</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the difference in average daily police stops between  Neighborhood A and Neighborhood B  has a <m>95</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[-15.0443887385979, -0.239611261402071]</m>.
