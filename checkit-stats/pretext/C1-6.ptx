  <statement>
      <p>
          A company wants to know what proportion of potential customers prefer their product to their competitors.  They want to find a <m> 95</m>% confidence interval with margin of error <m>ME=0.01</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
          A previous study showed that  of <m>66\ </m> survey respondents,  <m>41\ </m>preferred their product to their competitors.  How many people should now be surveyed to obtain a <m>95</m>% confidence interval with margin of error <m>ME=0.01</m>?

      <!--<ol>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the proportion of  that .

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      <ul>
          <li>
              The sample proportion of the initial study is <m>\hat{p}=0.6212121212121212</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              For a 95% confidence interval,  <m>z^*=1.9599639845400536</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The margin of error is <m>ME=0.01</m>.
