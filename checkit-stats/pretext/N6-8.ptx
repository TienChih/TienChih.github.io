  <statement>
      <p>A psychologist divides test subjects into different groups where they under a different digital interactive experience. Afterwards, she measures their resting heart rates to see if there was any difference.</p>
      
      <p>
          The average resting heart rate for test subjects in Group A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=89.099</m>  bpm, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=11.727</m> bpm, and sample size <m>n_1=34</m> test subjects.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average resting heart rate for test subjects in Group B was  <m>\bar{x}_2=84.966</m>  bpm, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=8.066</m> bpm, and sample size <m>n_2=37</m> test subjects.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          The average resting heart rate for test subjects in Group C was  <m>\bar{x}_3=82.217</m>  bpm, with sample standard deviation <m>s_3=9.975</m> bpm, and sample size <m>n_3=44</m> test subjects.

          The average resting heart rate of all <m>n=115</m> test subjects was <m>\bar{x}=85.1361</m>  bpm.
