          A business compares the amount it spends on advertising (thousands of dollars per month) to it's revenues (thousands of dollars per month) over it's last few months.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Consider this table of data collected comparing Advertising Expense measured in k dollars/month, and Revenue measured in k dollars/month:
