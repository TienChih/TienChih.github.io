      <p>
          A farmer is curious about the effects of a new fertilizer on the height of her corn stalks.  She measures the heights of a random selection of her stalks.  Out of  <m>49</m>  measured corn stalks, the sample average height  <m>\bar{x}=2.549</m>  meters, with sample standard deviation <m>s=0.197</m>  meters.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the average height of her corn stalks  is greater than <m>  2.5</m>  meters.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the  the average height of her corn stalks.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.
          </li>

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu=2.5</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu\gneq2.5</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>2.5</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.0281428571428571</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The sample mean is <m>\bar{x}=2.549</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=1.741116751269033</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.04403492424801314</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>95</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.0106347576242323</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the average height of her corn stalks  has a <m>95</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[2.49241499324972, 2.60558500675028]</m>.
