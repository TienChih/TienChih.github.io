      <p>
          A patient is tested for a disease.  We consider the events that they test positive for the disease, and the event that they have the disease.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that   the patient tests positive for the disease is <m>0.0733</m>, the probability that   the patient tests positive for the disease, given that they have it is <m>0.98</m>, and finally   the probability that    the patient has the disease is <m>0.0251</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that    the patient has the disase and tests positive for it.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that    the patient has the disease, given that they've tested positive for it.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Are the events   the patient tests positive for the disease, and    the patient has the disease independent?
              </li>
          </ol>

              <li>
                  The events   the patient tests positive for the disease, and    the patient has the disease  are not independent.
