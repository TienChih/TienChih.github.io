  <statement>
      <p>
          An engineer wants to know the probability that a new anti-rust coat stays on when exposed to rain-like conditions.  She wants to find a <m> 95</m>% confidence interval with margin of error <m>ME=0.04</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
          A previous study showed that  of <m>45\ </m> tested samples exposed to rain-like conditions,  <m>22\ </m>had the coating stay on.  How many samples should she now test to obtain a <m>95</m>% confidence interval with margin of error <m>ME=0.04</m>?
      </p>
      
      <!--<ol>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the proportion of  that .

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      <ul>
          <li>
              The sample proportion of the initial study is <m>\hat{p}=0.4888888888888889</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              For a 95% confidence interval,  <m>z^*=1.9599639845400536</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The margin of error is <m>ME=0.04</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The number of samples should she now test is at least <m>600</m>.
