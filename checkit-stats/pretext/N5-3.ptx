          A kinesiologist wants to compare the average finishing speeds of the 100 meter dash using two training techniques.  She wants to be able to detect a difference of <m> -0.1</m>  seconds. Suppose she is aware the finishing times of both methods have standard deviation  <m> 0.6</m>  seconds.
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              What is the power of a test if the number of 100 meter dashes she observed of each training method was  <m>n=50</m>?
          </li>
          <li>
              Explain what this power means in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              How many 100 meter dashes of each training method would she have to observe to detect this difference with power  <m>55</m>%?
          </li>
      </ol>

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The standard error if <m>n=50</m> would be <m>SE=0.120000000000000</m>.  The cutoff for a statistically significant test is a difference of <m>-0.23519567814480646</m>  seconds.  The power of the test is <m>P(X\leq -0.23519567814480646)=12.994933709194061</m>% where <m>X</m> is a normal variable with mean <m>-0.1</m> and standard error <m>0.120000000000000</m>.
         </li>
         <li>
             If there were actually a difference in finishing times of  <m>-0.1</m> seconds,  a study where the number of observations was  <m>n=50</m> would only have a <m>12.994933709194061</m>% chance of detecting it.
         </li>
         <li>
             The <m>z</m>-score for a left-tail of <m>55</m>% is <m>0.1256613468550741</m>.  So for this <m>55</m>% tail to be detectable, <m>-0.1+0.1256613468550741SE\approx -1.96SE</m>, so <m>SE\approx 0.04794725039760974 </m>, and for this to be true <m>n\geq 314</m>
         </li>
         
          
      </ul>
