      <p>
          A sociologist compares number of daily police stops in two different neighborhoods of the same city with similar size.  Out of  <m>33</m>  observed days, the daily number of stops for Neighborhood A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=51.053</m>  stops, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=4.241</m>  stops.  Then out of <m>33</m>  observed days, the daily number of stops for Neighborhood A was  <m>\bar{x}_2=49.528999999999996</m>  stops, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=3.912</m>  stops.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the difference in average daily police stops between  Neighborhood A and Neighborhood B, <m>\mu_1-\mu_2</m>, is not equal to <m>  0</m>  stops.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the  the difference in average daily police stops between  Neighborhood A and Neighborhood B.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu_1-\mu_2=0</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu_1-\mu_2\neq0</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0</m> and standard error <m>SE=1.00438168828268</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The observesd difference of sample means is <m>\bar{x_1}-\bar{x_2}=1.524</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=1.5173514389791107</m>.

              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.1389961656056944</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>95</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.036933343460101</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the difference in average daily police stops between  Neighborhood A and Neighborhood B  has a <m>95</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[-0.521858550423750, 3.56985855042375]</m>.
