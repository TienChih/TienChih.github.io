  <statement>
      
      <p>
          A manufacturer has two facilities A and B, each of whome occasionally produce defects.  We consider the events that a product is defective, and the event the product was manufactured in facility A.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that   a randomly selected product is defective given that it was manufactured in facility A is <m>0.0084</m>, the probability that   a randomly selected product is defective given that it was not manufactured in facility A is <m>0.0013</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  Suppose it were the case that the probability    a randomly selected product was manufactured in facility A was <m>0.64</m>.
                  <ol>
                      <li>
                          Find the probability that   a randomly selected product was defective.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Find the probability that    a randomly selected subject was manufactured in facility A, given that it was defective.
                      </li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Suppose instead that it was the case where the probability   a randomly selected product was defective was <m>0.0028</m>.  Find the probability that    a randomly selected product was manufactured in facility A.
              </li>
