      <p>
          A governer is running for re-election.  We consider the events that a voter votes for them, and the event that they are from a rural part of the state.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that   a randomly selected voter votes for the governor, given that they are from a rural part of the state is <m>0.66</m>, the probability that   a randomly selected voter votes for the governor, given that they are not from a rural part of the state is <m>0.24</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  Suppose it were the case that the probability    a randomly selected voter is from a rural part of the state was <m>0.13</m>.
                  <ol>
                      <li>
                          Find the probability that   a randomly selected voter votes for the governor.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Find the probability that    a randomly selected voter is from a rural part of the state, given that they voted for the governor.
                      </li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Suppose instead that it was the case where the probability   a randomly selected voter votes for the governor was <m>0.51</m>.  Find the probability that    a randomly selected voter is from a rural part of the state.
              </li>
              
          </ol>

                  <ol>
                      <li>
                          The probability that   a randomly selected voter votes for the governor is <m>0.2946</m>

                      <li>
                          The probability that    a randomly selected voter is from a rural part of the state, given that they voted for the governor is <m>0.29124236252545826</m>
