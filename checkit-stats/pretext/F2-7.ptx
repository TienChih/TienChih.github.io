  <statement>
      <p>
          A company wondered if people liked the user interface of their upgraded website.  They survey a random selection of their customers.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=56</m> surveyed customers, <m>20</m> preferred the new user interface. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the proportion of all the company's customers that prefer the new interface.
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              Suppose the company claims that   <m>34</m>% of all the company's customers  prefer the new interface.  Is this claim consistent with what we found?  Explain why or why not.
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          
          
          
          
      
  </statement>
  <answer>
      <ul>
          <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=\frac{5}{14}</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The standard error is <m>SE=0.0640301040714854</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              For a 95% confidence interval,  <m>z^*=1.9599639845400536</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The proportion of all the company's customers that prefer the new interface has a 95% chance of of falling in <m>[0.231646159236394, 0.482639555049320]</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The claim is consistent.
          </li>
      </ul>
