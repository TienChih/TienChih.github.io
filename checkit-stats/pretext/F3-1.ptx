  <statement>
      <p>
          A marine biologist wonders if the proportion of turtles in a coral reef that were infected with a new parasite is greater than <m>  45</m>%.  She gathers a sample of turtles.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=179</m> turtles found in the coral reef, <m>93</m> were infected. Test the hypothesis that  the proportion of turtles that are infected is greater than <m>  45</m>%. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: p=0.45</m>.

         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: p\gneq0.45</m>.

          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0.45</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.0371844263670399</m>.

         <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=0.5195530726256983</m> which has <m>z</m>-score <m>z=1.87048932634200</m>.
