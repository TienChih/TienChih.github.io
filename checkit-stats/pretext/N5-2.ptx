          A psychologist is testing average reaction times when testing different stimuli.  He wants to be able to detect a difference of  <m> -0.07</m>  seconds. Suppose he is aware the reaction times for both stimuli has standard deviation  <m> 0.29</m>  seconds.
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              What is the power of a test if the number of reactions for each stimuli was  <m>n=32</m>?
          </li>
          <li>
              Explain what this power means in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              How many reactions for each stimuli would have to observe to detect this difference with power  <m>80</m>%?
          </li>
      </ol>

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The standard error if <m>n=32</m> would be <m>SE=0.0725000000000000</m>.  The cutoff for a statistically significant test is a difference of <m>-0.14209738887915388</m>  seconds.  The power of the test is <m>P(X\leq -0.14209738887915388)=16.00027105197309</m>% where <m>X</m> is a normal variable with mean <m>-0.07</m> and standard error <m>0.0725000000000000</m>.
         </li>
         <li>
             If there were actually a difference in average reaction time of  <m>-0.07</m> seconds,  a study where the number of observed reactions was  <m>n=32</m> would only have a <m>16.00027105197309</m>% chance of detecting it.
         </li>
         <li>
             The <m>z</m>-score for a left-tail of <m>80</m>% is <m>0.8416212335729144</m>.  So for this <m>80</m>% tail to be detectable, <m>-0.07+0.8416212335729144SE\approx -1.96SE</m>, so <m>SE\approx 0.024985854275440925 </m>, and for this to be true <m>n\geq 270</m>
         </li>
         
          
      </ul>
