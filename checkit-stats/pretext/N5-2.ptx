      <p>
          A cybersecurity firm is testing two emergency shutdown systems.  They want to be able to detect a difference in response times of <m> -9.68</m>  milliseconds. Suppose the company is aware the shutdown times of both systems have standard deviation  <m> 18.39</m>  milliseconds.
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              What is the power of a test if the number of trials they ran of each was  <m>n=45</m>?
          </li>
          <li>
              Explain what this power means in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              How many trials of each system would the company have to run to detect this difference with power  <m>60</m>%?
          </li>
      </ol>

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The standard error if <m>n=45</m> would be <m>SE=3.87695241136643</m>.  The cutoff for a statistically significant test is a difference of <m>-7.598687096053925</m>  milliseconds.  The power of the test is <m>P(X\leq -7.598687096053925)=70.4311801073338</m>% where <m>X</m> is a normal variable with mean <m>-9.68</m> and standard error <m>3.87695241136643</m>.
         </li>
         <li>
             If there were actually a difference in shutdown times of  <m>-9.68</m> milliseconds,  a test where the number of trials was  <m>n=45</m> would only have a <m>70.4311801073338</m>% chance of detecting it.
         </li>
         <li>
             The <m>z</m>-score for a left-tail of <m>60</m>% is <m>0.2533471031357997</m>.  So for this <m>60</m>% tail to be detectable, <m>-9.68+0.2533471031357997SE\approx -1.96SE</m>, so <m>SE\approx 4.373537933235016 </m>, and for this to be true <m>n\geq 36</m>
         </li>
         
          
      </ul>
