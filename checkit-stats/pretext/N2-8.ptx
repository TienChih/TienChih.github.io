      <p>
          An engineer is studying the Brinell hardness of an experimental alloy.  She measures the hardness of a random collection of alloy samples.  Out of  <m>34</m>  measured alloy samples, the average sample hardness was  <m>\bar{x}=171.779</m>  Brinell hardness, with sample standard deviation <m>s=4.281</m>  Brinell hardness.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
          <li>  Test the hypothesis that  the average hardness of the alloy  is not equal to <m>  170</m>  Brinell hardness.
              <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
              Find a <m>99</m>% confidence interval for the  the average hardness of the alloy.  Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: \mu=170</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: \mu\neq170</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>170</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.734185442995080</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The sample mean is <m>\bar{x}=171.779</m> which has <m>t</m>-score <m>t=2.4230935344381614</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.021037961488303614</m>.
          </li>
         
         <li>
              For a <m>99</m>% confidence interval,  <m>t^*=2.7332766423508326</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The  the average hardness of the alloy  has a <m>99</m>% chance of of falling in <m>[169.772268077508, 173.785731922492]</m>.
