      <p>
          We consider a randomly selected student at a university, and consider the events that they major in biology and that they major in psychology
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that   the student is both a biology and a pscyhology major is <m>0.0099</m>, the probability that   the student is a biology major is <m>0.0203</m>, and finally   the probability that    the student is a psychology major is <m>0.041</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <p>
                      Find the probability that    the student is a biology major or the student is a psychology major.
                  </p>

              <li>
                  Find the probability that  the student is not a biology major but is a psychology major.
              </li>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that  the student is  a biology major or is not a psychology major.
