      <p>
          Suppose probability that a eligible voter will vote in a local midterm election is  <m>0.49</m>. A voting district has  <m>9856</m>  potential voters.  Let <m>X</m> denote the  number of eligible voters who will vote.  Find the following:
          
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <m>E(X)</m>, the expected  number of eligible voters who will vote.
              </li>
              
              <li>
                  <p>
                      <m>\sigma_A</m>, the standard deviation of the  number of eligible voters who will vote.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Then use the normal approximation of <m>X</m> to find the following:

              </li>
             
              <li>
                  Find the probability that the number of eligible voters who will vote is  between <m>4773 </m> and <m>4908</m>  potential voters.
              </li>
              
              
              <li>
                  Find <m>X^*</m> such that the probability that  number of eligible voters who will vote  is at most  <m>X^*</m>  potential voters is <m>0.8</m>.  (This value need not be a whole number.)
