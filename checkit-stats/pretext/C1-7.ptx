  <statement>
      <p>
          A university system administrator wants to know what proportion of students in their system prefer online courses.  She wants to find a <m> 99</m>% confidence interval with margin of error <m>ME=0.04</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
          A previous study showed that  of <m>68\ </m> surveyed students,  <m>15\ </m>preferred online classes.  How many students should she now survey to obtain a <m>99</m>% confidence interval with margin of error <m>ME=0.04</m>?
      </p>
      
      <!--<ol>
          <li>
              Find a <m>99</m>% confidence interval for the proportion of  that .
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      <ul>
          <li>
              The sample proportion of the initial study is <m>\hat{p}=0.22058823529411764</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              For a 99% confidence interval,  <m>z^*=2.5758293035489</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The margin of error is <m>ME=0.04</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The number of students should she now survey is at least <m>713</m>.
