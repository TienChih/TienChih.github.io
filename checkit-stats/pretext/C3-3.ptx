  <statement>
     <p>
         In previous locations, a restaurants the main protein for dinner entrees ordered by customers have been  <m>16</m>%  beef, <m>25</m>%  chicken, <m>26</m>%  pork, and <m>33</m>%  vegan.
      </p>
      <p>
          In a random sampling of dinner entrees ordered at their new location, the main proteins were  <m>21</m>  main proteins that were beef, <m>20</m>  main proteins that were chicken, <m>24</m>  main proteins that were pork, and <m>49</m>  main proteins that were vegan.
      </p>
      <p>
          Use a <m>\chi^2</m> goodness of fit test to test whether or not the distributions or ordered main proteins was the same at the new location as previous locations.

     <ul>

         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A:</m> The distribution of main proteins is different from previous locations.

          <li>
              There are <m>3</m> degrees of freedom.
