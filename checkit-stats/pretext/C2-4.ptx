      <p>
          A pharmacist is curious about the side effects of a trial drug between males and females.  She wants to know if the difference in rates of side effects between males and females is<m>\, </m> is not equal to <m>\,  -0.01</m>.  She tested the drug on male and female rats.
      </p>
      <p>
          Suppose that of   <m>n_1=199\, </m>tested male rats, <m>x_1=98\, </m>developed side effects and of <m>n_2=199\, </m>tested female rats, <m>x_2=83\, </m>developed side effects. Test the hypothesis that  the difference between the proportion of male rats who would develop side effects: <m>p_1</m>, and the proportion of female rats who would develop side effects: <m>p_2</m>,   is not equal to<m>\,  -0.01</m>.  That is <m>p_1-p_2\neq-0.01</m>.

      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.

          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.

         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: p_1-p_2\neq-0.01</m>.
