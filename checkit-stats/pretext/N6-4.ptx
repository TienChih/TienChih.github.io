      <p>
          The average electrical conductivity for alloy samples of Alloy A was  <m>\bar{x}_1=76.789</m>  million Siemens/meter, with sample standard deviation <m>s_1=11.196</m> million Siemens/meter, and sample size <m>n_1=46</m> alloy samples.

      <p>
          The average electrical conductivity for alloy samples of Alloy B was  <m>\bar{x}_2=83.062</m>  million Siemens/meter, with sample standard deviation <m>s_2=9.341</m> million Siemens/meter, and sample size <m>n_2=42</m> alloy samples.

      <p>
          The average electrical conductivity for alloy samples of Alloy C was  <m>\bar{x}_3=80.852</m>  million Siemens/meter, with sample standard deviation <m>s_3=10.436</m> million Siemens/meter, and sample size <m>n_3=47</m> alloy samples.
