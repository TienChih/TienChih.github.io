  <statement>
      <p>
          A company wondered if people liked the user interface of their upgraded website.  They survey a random selection of their customers.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=32</m> surveyed customers, <m>18</m> preferred the new user interface. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              Find a <m>99</m>% confidence interval for the proportion of all the company's customers that prefer the new interface.
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              Suppose the company claims that   <m>46</m>% of all the company's customers  prefer the new interface.  Is this claim consistent with what we found?  Explain why or why not.
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          
          
          
          
      
  </statement>
  <answer>
      <ul>
          <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=\frac{9}{16}</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The standard error is <m>SE=0.0876950950025143</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              For a 99% confidence interval,  <m>z^*=2.5758293035489</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The proportion of all the company's customers that prefer the new interface has a 99% chance of of falling in <m>[0.336612404515019, 0.788387595484981]</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The claim is consistent.
          </li>
      </ul>
