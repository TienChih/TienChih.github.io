  <statement>
      <p>
          An oncologist wishes to test a new treatment.  She performs an experiment exposing cancer cells to the treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=82</m> exposed cells, <m>54</m> were destroyed. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              Find a <m>95</m>% confidence interval for the proportion of cancer cells that would be destroyed.
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, explain what the confidence interval means in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              Suppose the oncologist claims that   <m>59</m>% of cancer cells  would be destroyed.  Is this claim consistent with what we found?  Explain why or why not.
          </li>
          
      </ol>
          
          
          
          
      
  </statement>
  <answer>
      <ul>
          <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=\frac{27}{41}</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The standard error is <m>SE=0.0523666891771132</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              For a 95% confidence interval,  <m>z^*=1.9599639845400536</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The proportion of cancer cells that would be destroyed has a 95% chance of of falling in <m>[0.555899760589108, 0.761173410142599]</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The claim is consistent.
          </li>
      </ul>
