  <statement>
      <p>
          A software engineer wonders about the levels of errors in two beta versions of a product.  They want to know if the rates of crashing between version A and version B<m>\, </m> is less than <m>\,  -0.05</m>.  They test run each version a number of times.
      </p>
      <p>
          Suppose that of   <m>n_1=176\, </m>test runs of version A, <m>x_1=77\, </m>times the product crashed and of <m>n_2=176\, </m>test runs of version B, <m>x_2=105\, </m>times the product crashed. Test the hypothesis that  the difference between the proportion of times running version A who will crash: <m>p_1</m>, and the proportion of times running version B who will crash: <m>p_2</m>,   is less than<m>\,  -0.05</m>.  That is <m>p_1-p_2\lneq-0.05</m>.

      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: p_1-p_2=-0.05</m>.

         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: p_1-p_2\lneq-0.05</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>-0.05</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.0525899633032094</m>.

         <li>
              The difference in sample proportions is <m>\hat{p}=-0.15909090909090906</m> which has <m>z</m>-score <m>z=-2.07436746935801</m>.
