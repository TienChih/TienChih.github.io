      <p>
          Suppose the retirement age of professional athletes in a certain league is normally distributed with mean   <m>33.33</m>  years and standard deviation <m>2.1</m>  years.  Find the following:

      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age   is at most  <m>36.03 </m>  years.
              </li>
             
              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age  is between <m>31.51 </m> and <m>39.1</m>  years.
