          A farmer tests two different pesticides on his crops during an insect infestation.  Sprays two sections of his field with the different pestisides, and records the resulting infestation levels:

      <p>
          <me>
              \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
              \hline
              &amp; \text{ No Infestation } &amp; \text{ Moderate Infestation } &amp; \text{ Severe Infestation }\\
              \hline
              \text{ Pesticide A } &amp; 36 &amp; 24 &amp; 39\\
              \hline
              \text{ Pesticide B } &amp; 52 &amp; 10 &amp; 35\\

      <p>
          Use a <m>\chi^2</m> independence test to test  whether the level of infestation is independent of the type of pesticide used.

      <ul>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis for this test.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis for this test.
          </li>
          <li>

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0:\ </m>Infestation levels are independent of pesticide type.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A:\ </m>Infestation levels are not independent of pesticide type.
          </li>
          <li>
              There are <m>2</m> degrees of freedom.
