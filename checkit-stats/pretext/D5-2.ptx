          Suppose probability that a PC needs repairing over the course of a year is  <m>0.08</m>. A company uses  <m>505</m>  PCs.  Let <m>X</m> denote the  number of PCs that will need repair this year.  Find the following:

      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <m>E(X)</m>, the expected  number of PCs that will need repair this year.
              </li>
              
              <li>
                  <p>
                      <m>\sigma_A</m>, the standard deviation of the  number of PCs that will need repair this year.

                  <p>
                      Then use the normal approximation of <m>X</m> to find the following:

              </li>
             
              <li>
                  Find the probability that the number of PCs that will need repair is  between <m>42 </m> and <m>50</m>  PCs.

              <li>
                  Find <m>X^*</m> such that the probability that  number of PCs that will need repair this year  is at most  <m>X^*</m>  PCs is <m>0.8</m>.  (This value need not be a whole number.)
