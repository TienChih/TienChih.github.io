          Suppose there is a mishap with the feed of a herd of cattle, and some of the cattle get sick.  When the ranchers test the cattle, the probability that each cow got sick is  <m>0.38</m>. A cattle herd has  <m>50</m>  cows.  Let <m>X</m> denote the  number of cattle that got sick.  Find the following:
          
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <m>E(X)</m>, the expected  number of cattle that got sick.
              </li>
              
              <li>
                  <p>
                      <m>\sigma_A</m>, the standard deviation of the  number of cattle that got sick.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Then use the normal approximation of <m>X</m> to find the following:
                  </p>
                  
              </li>
             
              <li>
                  Find the probability that the number of number of cattle who got sick is  between <m>20 </m> and <m>27</m>  cows.
              </li>
              
              
              <li>
                  Find <m>X^*</m> such that the probability that  number of cattle that got sick  is at least  <m>X^*</m>  cows is <m>0.72</m>.  (This value need not be a whole number.)
              </li>
