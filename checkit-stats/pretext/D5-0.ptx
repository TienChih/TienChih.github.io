          Suppose there is a vaccine is developed to combat a novel virus.  The probability an eligible adult takes the vaccine is  <m>0.47</m>. The number of eligible adults in a town is  <m>81300</m>  adults.  Let <m>X</m> denote the  number of adults who take the vaccine.  Find the following:
          
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <m>E(X)</m>, the expected  number of adults who take the vaccine.
              </li>
              
              <li>
                  <p>
                      <m>\sigma_A</m>, the standard deviation of the  number of adults who take the vaccine.

                  <p>
                      Then use the normal approximation of <m>X</m> to find the following:

              <li>
                  Find the probability that the number of adults who take the vaccine is  between <m>37920 </m> and <m>37981</m>  adults.

              <li>
                  Find <m>X^*</m> such that the probability that  number of adults who take the vaccine  is at most  <m>X^*</m>  adults is <m>0.7</m>.  (This value need not be a whole number.)
