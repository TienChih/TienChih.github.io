          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age   is at least  <m>26.04 </m>  years.

              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age  is between <m>28.52 </m> and <m>31.79</m>  years.
