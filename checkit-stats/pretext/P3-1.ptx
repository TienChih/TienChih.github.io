      <p>
          A test is administered for a health condition.  We consider the events that they test positive for the condition, and the event they have the condition.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that   the subject tests positive for the condition, given that they have the condition is <m>0.99</m>, the probability that   the subject tests positive for the condition, given that they do not have the condition is <m>0.29</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  Suppose it were the case that the probability    the subject has  the condition was <m>0.2</m>.
                  <ol>
                      <li>
                          Find the probability that   the subject tests positive for the condition.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                          Find the probability that    the subject has the condition, given that they test positive for the condition.
                      </li>
                  </ol>
              </li>
              <li>
                  Suppose instead that it was the case where the probability   the subject tests positive for the condition was <m>0.62</m>.  Find the probability that    the subject has  the condition.
