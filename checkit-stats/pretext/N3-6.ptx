          A study is done comparing the effect of two diets on levels of cholestrol.  Subjects of the study spend 2 weeks on diet A, their cholestrol is measured, then they switch to diet B, and after 2 weeks their cholestrol is measured again. A total of <m>23</m>  subjects were sampled.  The following is a summary of cholestrol level after diet A and cholestrol level after diet B.
