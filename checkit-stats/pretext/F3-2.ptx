  <statement>
      <p>
          An engineer tests to see if the he proproportion of iron samples, when sprayed with a new compound, would rust when exposed to water is less than <m>  67</m>%.  He conducts an experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=184</m> iron samples, <m>110</m> rusted. Test the hypothesis that  the proportion of iron samples that would rust is less than <m>  67</m>%. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.

          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: p=0.67</m>.

         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: p\lneq0.67</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0.67</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.0346645414621715</m>.

         <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=0.5978260869565217</m> which has <m>z</m>-score <m>z=-2.08206743834300</m>.

              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.01866815512783988</m>.
