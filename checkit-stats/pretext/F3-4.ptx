  <statement>
      <p>
          A CEO is curious if the proportion of employees that are satisfied with their job is less than <m>  51</m>%.  They conduct a survey of employees.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=153</m> surveyed employees, <m>68</m> were satisfied with their job. Test the hypothesis that  the proportion of all employees that are satisfied with their job is less than <m>  51</m>%. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: p=0.51</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: p\lneq0.51</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0.51</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.0404145188432738</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=0.4444444444444444</m> which has <m>z</m>-score <m>z=-1.62207932772324</m>.
          </li>

          <!--<li>
              For a % confidence interval,  <m>z^*=</m>.
          </li>
