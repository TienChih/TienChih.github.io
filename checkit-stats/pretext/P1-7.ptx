  <statement>
      
      <p>
          We consider the event that at a fast food resturaunt, a random customer orders burgers, and the event they order fries.  We consider an arbitrarily selected customer.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Suppose that   the probability that   the customer orders both burger and fries is <m>0.5905</m>, the probability that    the customer orders fries is <m>0.6812</m>, and finally   the probability that    the customer orders either burger or fries is <m>0.6906</m>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <ol>
              <li>
                  <p>
                      Find the probability that   the customer orders a burger.

              <li>
                  Find the probability that  the customer does not order a burger, but does order fries.

              <li>
                  Find the probability that  the customer  orders a burger, or does not order fries.
