      <p>
          Suppose the retirement age of professional athletes in a certain league is normally distributed with mean   <m>33.31</m>  years and standard deviation <m>2.99</m>  years.  Find the following:

          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age   is at most  <m>40.94 </m>  years.
              </li>
             
              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age  is between <m>34.8 </m> and <m>41.9</m>  years.
