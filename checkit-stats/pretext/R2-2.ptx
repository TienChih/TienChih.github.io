          A survey is conducted comparing different homes electricity usage (in kilowatt hours), and their electric bills (dollars) within a city.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Consider this table of data collected comparing Electricity Usage measured in kilowatt hours, and Electric Bill measured in dollars:
