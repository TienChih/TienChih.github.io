          A study is conducted examining how far a car has driven (in thousands of miles) compared to how expensive the annual maintenance costs are.
      </p>
      
      <p>
          Consider this table of data collected comparing Distance Driven measured in thousand miles, and Maintenance Cost measured in dollars:
