          Two professors poll their students to see if they believe their class was difficult.  They students rate the class difficulty as Low, Moderate or High:
      </p>
      
      
      <p>
          <me>
              \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
              \hline
              &amp; \text{ Low } &amp; \text{ Medium } &amp; \text{ High }\\
              \hline
              \text{ Dr. Owens } &amp; 29 &amp; 23 &amp; 81\\
              \hline
              \text{ Dr. Trahn } &amp; 36 &amp; 19 &amp; 42\\
              \hline
              \end{array}
          </me>
          
      </p>
      
      
     
      <p>
          Use a <m>\chi^2</m> independence test to test  whether the percieved difficulty is independent of the professor.
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis for this test.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis for this test.
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?
          </li>
      </ul>

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0:\ </m>Self-reported levels of difficulty are independent of the professor.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A:\ </m>Self-reported levels of difficulty are not independent of the professor.
          </li>
          <li>
              There are <m>2</m> degrees of freedom.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>\chi^2</m> value is <m>8.06341564660545</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The <m>p</m>-value is <m>0.017744000444866903</m>.
