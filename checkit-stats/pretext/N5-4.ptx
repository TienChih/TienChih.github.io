      <p>
          A cybersecurity firm is testing two emergency shutdown systems.  They want to be able to detect a difference in response times of <m> -5.45</m>  milliseconds. Suppose the company is aware the shutdown times of both systems have standard deviation  <m> 36.64</m>  milliseconds.
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              What is the power of a test if the number of trials they ran of each was  <m>n=27</m>?
          </li>
          <li>
              Explain what this power means in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              How many trials of each system would the company have to run to detect this difference with power  <m>80</m>%?
          </li>
      </ol>

  <answer>
      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The standard error if <m>n=27</m> would be <m>SE=9.97214490839729</m>.  The cutoff for a statistically significant test is a difference of <m>-19.54504486907317</m>  milliseconds.  The power of the test is <m>P(X\leq -19.54504486907317)=7.876295452920629</m>% where <m>X</m> is a normal variable with mean <m>-5.45</m> and standard error <m>9.97214490839729</m>.
         </li>
         <li>
             If there were actually a difference in shutdown times of  <m>-5.45</m> milliseconds,  a test where the number of trials was  <m>n=27</m> would only have a <m>7.876295452920629</m>% chance of detecting it.
         </li>
         <li>
             The <m>z</m>-score for a left-tail of <m>80</m>% is <m>0.8416212335729144</m>.  So for this <m>80</m>% tail to be detectable, <m>-5.45+0.8416212335729144SE\approx -1.96SE</m>, so <m>SE\approx 1.9453272257307577 </m>, and for this to be true <m>n\geq 710</m>
         </li>
         
          
      </ul>
