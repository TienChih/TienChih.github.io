          Suppose a group of people are in a room for extended time with someone infected with a novel virus.  Each of the  <m>7</m>  people has a <m>0.33</m> chance of  contracting the virus.  Suppose that whether or not each  person  contract the virus is independent of the other  people.  Find the following:
