          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age   is at least  <m>24.58 </m>  years.

              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected athlete's retirement age  is between <m>29.26 </m> and <m>34.15</m>  years.
