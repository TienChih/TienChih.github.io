      <p>
          Suppose the braking distance of cars of a certain model travelling at 60 mph is normally distributed with mean   <m>134.25</m>  feet and standard deviation <m>5.7</m>  feet.  Find the following:

          <ol>
              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected car's braking distance   is at least  <m>146.92 </m>  feet.

              <li>
                  Find the probability that a randomly selected car's braking distance  is between <m>135.37 </m> and <m>144.65</m>  feet.
