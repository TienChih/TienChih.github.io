  <statement>
      <p>
          A marine biologist wonders if the proportion of turtles in a coral reef that were infected with a new parasite is less than <m>  55</m>%.  She gathers a sample of turtles.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=396</m> turtles found in the coral reef, <m>198</m> were infected. Test the hypothesis that  the proportion of turtles that are infected is less than <m>  55</m>%. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?

              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: p=0.55</m>.

              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: p\lneq0.55</m>.

         <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=0.5</m> which has <m>z</m>-score <m>z=-2.00000000000000</m>.
