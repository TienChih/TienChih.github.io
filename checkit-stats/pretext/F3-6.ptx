  <statement>
      <p>
          A marine biologist wonders if the proportion of turtles in a coral reef that were infected with a new parasite is not equal to <m>  52</m>%.  She gathers a sample of turtles.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=214</m> turtles found in the coral reef, <m>96</m> were infected. Test the hypothesis that  the proportion of turtles that are infected is not equal to <m>  52</m>%. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?

      <title>Partial Solution:</title>
      
     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: p=0.52</m>.
          </li>
         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: p\neq0.52</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0.52</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.0341519419680187</m>.

         <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=0.4485981308411215</m> which has <m>z</m>-score <m>z=-2.09071183201653</m>.

          <li>
              The proportion of turtles that are infected has a % chance of of falling in <m>[, ]</m>.
