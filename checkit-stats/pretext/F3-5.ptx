  <statement>
      <p>
          An education researcher wants to know of the proportion if college students who find a certain subject challenging is greater than <m>  46</m>%.  They conduct a survey of college students.
      </p>
      <p>
Suppose that for   <m>n=353</m> surveyed students, <m>181</m> found the subject challenging. Test the hypothesis that  the proportion of all college students that find the subject challenging is greater than <m>  46</m>%. 
      </p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>
              State the null hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              State the alternative hypothesis.
          </li>
          <li>
              What is the <m>p</m>-value?
          </li>
          <li>
              Using complete sentences, state the meaning of the <m>p</m>-value in the context of this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
              What do we conclude?  Why?

     <ul>
          <li>
              The null hypothesis is <m>H_0: p=0.46</m>.

         <li>
              The alternative hypothesis is <m>H_A: p\gneq0.46</m>.
          </li>
          <li>
              The sampling distribution has mean <m>0.46</m> and standard error <m>SE=0.0265270186705318</m>.

         <li>
              The sample proportion is <m>\hat{p}=0.5127478753541076</m> which has <m>z</m>-score <m>z=1.98845848488447</m>.
