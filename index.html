											<p> I grew up in Hilo, Hawaii where I graduated from Hilo High School.  After briefly attending college in Chicago, I took a break from school and worked various odd jobs few years. Afterwards, I returned to
		  Hilo where I attended the University of Hawaii at Hilo. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my life, but after a life changing class with Dr. Ramon Figueroa-Centeno, I decided that I wanted to be a Mathematician, and that I wanted to help other students find their love for Mathematics!  After that I  attended the University of Montana for graduate school where I earned a Doctorate in Mathematics.  I held the position of Assistant Professor at Newberry College in South Carolina for three years before returning to Montana and joining the faculty of MSUB in 2017.</p>

								I was fortunate that  I returned to school to rediscover my love and passion for mathematics.  This was in large part to the excellent faculty at UH Hilo, and in particular, my mentor Dr. Ramon Figueroa-Centeno.  It was then that I made the decision to become a mathematician, and in particular, to become a teacher-scholar who helped other students redefine their relationship with mathematics.  Unfortunately, math is not the most beloved subject amongst students, and so a lot of care and effort is needed to help them reforge a new positive relationship with the subject.  Students frequently are turned off by math because they see themselves as "not a math person", or they don't see the relevance of mathematics to themselves.  I now focus on student centered pedagogy, giving them ownership of their own learning.  I center the view that everyone can grow to love, appreciate and excel at mathematics.

							<h3>High Impact Practices (HIPs):</h3>
							<p>
								
							<a href="https://www.aacu.org/sites/default/files/files/LEAP/HIP_tables.pdf" target="_blank">High Impact Practices</a> are educational experiences or practices and have demonstrably shown to have positive effects on student learning and retention.  I was part of an inagural cohort of MSUB faculty who incorpoated HIPS into our courses.  I redesigned by Introductory Stats course to include a group research and presentation component.  This redesign recieved overwhlemingly positive feedback, and as a result of this work, I was selected to be an inagural <a href="https://www.mus.edu/che/arsa/mus-teaching-scholars/2019-2020.html" target="_blank">Montana Regents Teaching Scholar</a>.  As a RTS, I led a diverse cohort of MSU Billings faculty to incorporate experiential and service learning elements into their own first-year courses.
							</p>

							<div class="row" >
							<h3>Educational Technology:</h3>
							<p>
								I spent years of my life working odd jobs and struggling financially, and seeing my students do the same, I wanted to eliminate financial strain as an impediment to student learning.  I recieved several <a href="https://trailsmt.org/" target="_blank">TRAILS</a> OER grants to implement and review OER resources for my classrooms.  I have written several OER texts using PreTeXt. 
							</p>
							<p>
								  Technology can change the way to deliver other aspects of our courses.  I started down this road writing WebWork problems for <a href="https://edfinity.com/products/5c5b69d134991938ed32e52d" target="_blank">introductory statistics</a>.  I recently become involved with Dr. Steven Clontz and <a href="https://checkit.clontz.org/" target="_blank">CheckIt</a>, a platform designed for generating problem banks for assesments.  I worked with him to deploy banks in the Brightspace LMS, and wrote my own <a href="checkit-stats/index.html" target="_blank">statistics bank</a>.  Due to the pressures of distance learning with working rural students, I experimented with an asynchronous inquiry course.  I wrote about my experience <a href="https://blogs.ams.org/matheducation/2020/11/01/the-choice-to-go-asynchronous-discussion-board-based-ibl/" target="_blank">here</a>, and published a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10511970.2021.1955781" target="_blank">paper</a> on how one could incorporate asynchronous elements in math courses regardless of modality.

							<h3>Team Based Inquiry Learning (TBIL)</h3>
							<p>
								In 2021, I was selected to be a TBIL Fellow as a part of an <a href="https://sites.google.com/southalabama.edu/tbil/" target="_blank">NSF funded project</a>.   TBIL is a way to incorporate Inquiry learning in a scaffolded way into lower division mathematics courses.  As a part of this cohort, I am tasked with developing Calculus 2 learning materials, authoring them in PreTeXt, and developing CheckIt assesments aligned with our outcomes.  These materials once complete will be made publically available.

                  Dr. Tien Chih is one of the best math professors I have had since I have been at MSUB. He did a great job at presenting the material, working with students to ensure we understood the material, and took the time to teach how to solve any problem based on a concept, not just how to solve a single problem. The structure of the class was very clear and I felt comfortable asking Dr. Chih for help.

                  I have recommended him to many of my fellow schoolmates that are looking to take this class. I am the only one that is in my group for a final project and really takes the time to make sure I am doing well. He is a true poster teacher for if you put in the effort, you will succeed. He truly shows that if you care and put in some time to the class that is needed then you will get the grade you deserve.

                  Dr. Chih went above and beyond to ensure understanding of course materials. He was also flexible with assignments and communicated clearly with students. He is a credit to MSUB.

                  Really enjoyed having Tien Chih as an instructor. He is very engaging in his approach and makes sure to still have some fun in his classes. This class was hard to say the least, but Chih was always available for extra help when we needed it. Love how enthusiastic and passionate he is about math and it creates a positive environment for students!

                  I liked the discussion style and investigative aspect of the course. It seemed more science based instead of just solving problems, and although we did do many problems, I feel like I have a deeper understanding of high level math that I didn't think I was capable of.

          <p>"I like crossing the imaginary boundaries people set up between different fields—it's very refreshing. There are lots of tools, and you don't know which one would work. It's about being optimistic and trying to connect things."-Maryam Mirzakhani</p>

			  My current research focuses on taking ideas from classical homotopy in topology and extending them to graphs via \(\times\)-homotopy.  One could just consider the homotopy of graphs as simplicial spaces, but this isn't very interesting!  Instead we define homotopy categorically, with looped paths taking the place of the unit interval, and graph homomorphisms taking the place of continuous functions.  In our first paper, my collaborator Dr. Laura Scull and I gave a concrete description on how the "continuous" motions of classical homotopy translate to "discrete" motions in graphs.  The gif below depicts a homotopy between two functions.

			  One may suspect that results about classical homotopy would translate readily, but these are really very different settings.  For example the product of two connected spaces is always connected, but the product of connected graphs need not be connected!  So it isn't obvious that all classical homotopy results have analogues in \(\times\)-homotopy, and it's not clear how these analogues, when they exist, differ.  This makes this an interesting line of research!  We have several papers developing \(\times\)-homotopy, with more planned and on the way!

							<h3>Undergraduate Research</h3>
							<p>
								Our line of work is particularly suited for undergraduate scholars: the objects and functions are finite and concrete, the area is new so it is easy to pick unexplored topics, and while it is new research, one can look to established results in classical homotopy for inspiration and guidance.

				  Dr. Scull and I applied for and the Center for Undergraduate Research in Mathematics (CURM) mini-grant, which we recieved for the 20-21 academic year.  I supervised a team of student scholars who examined the homotopies of automorphisms &amp; endomorphisms of graphs.   They gave a talk on their work in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hylQFTKHDyQ" target="_blank">Talk Math With Your Friends</a> online seminar, and wrote a <a href="https://cocalc.com/share/9c7f4f5033fd8b9d7383802313e1addf10fdb416/SpiderNests.ipynb?viewer=share" target="_blank">jupyter notebook</a> visualizing their computations in an interactive way!

				  If you're interested in graphs, groups, shapes, enumeration, coding, or just playing around in a cool new setting, I would love to talk with you about collaboration!  Please contact me if you are interested.

			  I am the founder of the MSU-Billings Math Circle, which as been ongoing for 4 years.  We're happily supported by the Mathematical Association of America DMEG grant.  We've had close to 100 students attend over the years, even through the pandemic.  This program is free, and open to all students grades 4-8, teachers and parents.  We play games, explore activities, work on puzzles, and work together to discover new and wonderful mathematics!  We recruit MSUB students including pre-service teachers, for which I've recieved the Universities Pippenger Awars.
		  </p>
			  
		  <p>
			  To expand the reach of Math Circles, I've become involved in the leadership and organization of Math Circles.  I  serve as the associate editor of the Journal of Math Circles, program coordinator of the MCTS SIGMAA, and was a co-organizer for the 2021 Circle on the Road workshop.
