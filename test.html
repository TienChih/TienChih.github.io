									Unfortunately, many people have the mistaken idea that math is just a set of rules and calculations. That is not mathematics.  You could be working at the Disney Research Group using math to create realistic-looking hair in the movie Moana, you could be designing a new method for Netflix to determine what movies a subscriber would like, or you could even be working on an abstract math problem that uncovers new results, such as finding a fast algorithm to determine whether or not a number is prime. That is how I see math and why I love it. To me, mathematics is beautiful.

								<p>My dissertation work was done in geometric group theory which involves a little bit of analysis,

							<h2>      Undergradaute Research Projects:     </h2>
							<p>
								
								<b> Project 1: Applying Linear Algebra to Sports Analytics </b> 
								<br />Ranking sports teams can be a challenging task and using straight win percentage can be misleading at times. 
								Among the many mathematically inspired sports ranking systems, linear algebra methods like Markov Chains and the Massey and Colley methods are among the most elegant
								and simple. Both involve setting up and solving a matrix system. While at their most basic level, these methods are 
								useful for sports rankings, unfortunately, they are not particularly strong at predicting future outcomes of games. 
								One way to improve these methods for ranking and predicting future outcomes is by introducing weights to these systems. This research 
								involves collecting sports data, and adding and testing features and weights to modified linear algebra and probability-based models. This research also often involves
								writing programs to construct huge systems of equations, so some programming experience is helpful, but by no means necessary. 
								<i> <ul> Background Needed: This research involves linear algebra, programming, and some data analytics and is appropriate for students who have taken 
								Linear Algebra and have some programming background. </i> </ul>
								
								
								<b> Project 2: Determining Optimal Strategies for DNA Self-Assembly Using Tile-Based Assembly and Graphs </b> 
								<br />Motivated by the discovery of new laboratory techniques, formal graph theory has recently become useful 
								in the study of self-assembling DNA complexes. Construction methods developed with concepts from undergraduate level 
								graph theory have resulted in significantly increased efficiency. One recent focus in DNA nanotechnology is the formation 
								of nanotubes using lattice structures. These nanotubes are thought to have wide-ranging potential, such as containers 
								for the transport and release of nano-cargos, as templates for the controlled growth of nano-objects, and in 
								drug-delivery methods. Rules governing the structure of these nanotubes are not yet well understood, and this naturally 
								offers open problems in the realm of applied graph theory. <br />
								<i> <ul> Background Needed: This research can be introduced to students with little mathematical background. It involves basic graph theory
									(Eulerian graphs, trees, paths, cycles, etc.) and depending on the student's
									background and interests may also involve programming, computer graphics, art, biology, and geometry. 
								</ul> </i>  
								
								<b> Project 3: Mastery-based Testing SoTL/Educational Research </b> 
								<br />As educators, it is important to recognize that our assessment methods affect student attitudes. If we 
								want students to learn from their mistakes and counteract a fixed-mindset of learning, perhaps we should look
								at what we incentivize in the classroom. One way that professors are attempting to counteract math anxiety, 
								poor STEM retention, and a fixed-mindset of learning is through using and researching a new assessment model
								called <a href="https://mbtmath.wordpress.com/" > "mastery-based testing" (MBT). </a>  In MBT, students are given problems in which they can only receive full 
								credit for the problem after they demonstrate mastery of the concept being tested. Each test includes similar 
								questions over the same concepts from previous tests which allows students who have not mastered an idea to retest 
								and reevaluate old concepts. In this research we analyze qualitative and quantitative data from 
								classes using MBT and compare it to classes using traditional assessment.<br/>   
								
								<i> <ul> Background Needed: This research involves some statistical analysis and data analytics and is appropriate for students who have taken 
									a statistics class (preferably Applied Probability and Statistics). Students involved in this research must complete 
									an online CITI training which provides foundational training in human subjects research and includes the historical 
								development of human subject protections, ethical issues, and current regulatory and guidance information.</ul></i>

								<h2>Teaching</h2>
								
								<p>"It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge." - Albert Einstein <br />
								</div>
								<img src="assets/img/teachingCalc3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br /> 
								
								I am extremely fortunate. I grew up with parents who loved me and loved math, hopefully in that order. I remember working on homework with my dad, an electrical engineer, 
								and how excited he was to discuss the cool and interesting aspects of calculus with me. At the time, I was more focused on ''getting the right answer'', 
								but my dad was the first one to show me the beauty and creativity that is mathematics. I also have had many amazing, enthusiastic math teachers throughout 
								my years in school who have inspired me to do what they do. Their approach to teaching mathematics made their classes interesting, challenging, and fun by 
								using activities rather than didactic lecturing. My favorite teacher in high school would say, ''we are in school to learn to think creatively and 
								logically'',  and as I progress in my career as a mathematics educator, I have adopted his mantra. Learning to think creatively and logically is more than a grade, it is a 
								life skill that will help students be successful in whatever they choose to be in the future, from engineer to economist! This is my mission as a teacher,
								to enable my students to process the world around them in a creative and logical manner. I believe this mission is closely aligned with Lewis' Lasallian 
								mission especially regarding the pursuit of lifelong learning skills through creative and critical interactions. I also think that, as educators, we need 
								to question how our methods affect student attitudes toward mathematics. Specifically, I want my teaching to instill a growth-mindset of learning. 
								That is, I want to emphasize that learning is not based on the amount of intelligence possessed by a student, but that understanding can be developed 
							through effort and motivation. These goals as an educator have shaped how I teach, how I serve, and how I approach research.  </p>

							<h2>      Pedagogical and Service Projects:     </h2>
							<p>
								
							I have also been very active in scholarly activities beyond these areas and am involved in projects related to pedagogy, 
							K-12 teacher professional development, and graduate student mentorship. In 2018, I was one of 28 professors invited to present 
							and participate in an NSF funded workshop, National Pedagogical Initiatives on Linear Algebra, at the University of Oklahoma. 
							This group is working to update the current Mathematical Association of America’s pedagogical recommendations for teaching linear algebra. 
							I led a session on "Incorporating Applications into Linear Algebra Courses" with my collaborator Dr. Marie Snipes of Kenyan College and the ImageMath group. 
							I have also worked with ACMS Gold ’14 Project NExT faculty members organizing job search workshops for graduate students. I have been the main organizer for these workshops and have presented our 
							collaborative work at two ACMS conferences and at the Indiana MAA Sectional Meetings. As part of the Southwest Chicago Math Teachers’ group, 
							I also regularly present sessions at our meetings. These sessions involve creating an interactive activity that delves into interesting mathematics.
							This contributes to the advancement of learning for K-college students and faculty. Some of the sessions I have run include exploring binary 
							number tricks with liar’s bingo, modeling polynomial division using exploding dots, analyzing the “fairness” of voting schemes, and exploring 
							mathematics of the game Prime Climb. I have been the invited speaker at Dordt University’s Math Teachers’ Circle Kick-off Event and for the 
							2020 Virtual Math Teachers'	Circle Summer Workshop hosted by AIM.I also have been recognized as someone with experience with Data Science both 
							with my sports modeling research and from working with Dr. Piotr Szczurek. I was invited to give a presentation about our data science program 
							at the 2018 JMM SIAM Mini-symposium on Data Science in the Mathematics Curriculum. I also served as an external program reviewer a university's undergraduate 
							program in data science.

									<p>	I have done several outreach projects including a free Math Camp in which students learned about graph theory, probability, and 3D printing! 
										At the end of the week, students created their own games and 3D printed their own game pieces using what they learned during the week.  I have also served the local community by running local math camps at IMSA and helping with DataThon and Girls' Create with Technology. Girls Create 
										with Technology is designed to engage girls in computer science and STEM activities. Girls participating in the program will receive advanced 
										training in various aspects of Computer Science from Lewis University faculty and students. 
										I am also a part of the leadership team  for the <a href="https://southwestchicagomathcircle.wordpress.com/" > 
										the Southwest Chicago Math Teachers' Circle! </a> <br />
										<br />
										This Math Circle provides the opportunity for 5th -12th grade math teachers and local college professors to collaborate 
										on developing and refining the problem-solving skills of local teachers and students. This community of learners provides math 
										instructors a supportive network to discuss mathematical and pedagogical issues that arise in the classroom and gives teachers 
										support and resources to initiate more student-centered, inquiry-based pedagogies in their classrooms. I have also found that 
										this math circle helps teachers rekindle their enjoyment of solving interesting and challenging math problems in a supportive 
										group environment. To get this program started, I recruited teachers from St. Xavier University, Trinity Christian College, 
										University of St. Francis, College of DuPage, St. Bede the Venerable Elementary School, and Taft Elementary to help serve 
										on our leadership team. I have also served as the faculty advisor for the <a href="http://www.cs.lewisu.edu/mathclub/" > Lewis Math Club! </a> <br /> 
										
										As the faculty sponsor for the Lewis Math Club, I work closely with the club's officers to help them run events 
										like the annual Math Careers Panel, Pi-Day, Meet an Actuary, Math Bash, 
										canned food drives, poker nights, and more. I have also taken over 30 majors to local conferences and ACCA events.
